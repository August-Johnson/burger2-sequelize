# WEEK 15 HOMEWORK - EAT-DA-BURGER (SEQUELIZE EDITION)

<p>This week's homework assignment was optional. It was the same as <a href="https://github.com/August-Johnson/burger">the original</a>, except using the sequelize package. There were three levels of difficulty for this assignment. I was only able to complete the basic one, although I did attempt the challenging versions. The challenging versions had you create a second model and database table and connect/associate it with the original 'burgers' table somehow. I was able to create a new model of 'Customer' and from the page, create/add a new customer with a form. I was not able to figure out how to connect the two in a relevant way (not just linking a name to a burger, but actually associating the id of one to the other).</p>


## CHALLENGES
* I struggled quite a bit with the concept of associations and how to implement them on a page/app.
* The layout of handlebars was still new to me, so I didn't do anything fancy for the page's layout/styling.
